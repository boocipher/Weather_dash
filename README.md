## Description
The Wather_dash is a single page app that allows users to easily access current and 5-day forecast weather information for locations globally. Thanks to the integration with Open Weather API, data on temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index is displayed. Previously searched locations remain available for quick and easy navigation below the search box.


## Usage
The Wather_dash is deployed via GitHub pages and can be accessed at [https://boocipher.github.io/Weather_dash/](https://boocipher.github.io/Weather_dash/)
<br> Below is a screenshot of the page as an example as it is still in a 'work in progress' stage
